            <h1>Birth/Death Demograpics</h1>

            <li>Most Current Population: Sweden's current population is roughly 10,179,361 people. All this shows is how many people live in Sweden right now.</li>
            <li>Crude Birth Rate: CBR in Sweden is currently around 10.6. This means for every thousand people in Sweden, there was around 11 babies born in 2020.  </li>
            <li>Crude Death Rate: CDR is slightly lower at about 9.6. This shows that in 2020 for every 1000 people in Sweden, 9.6 died. </li>
            <img src="../Images/demo-trans.png" alt="">
            <li>Natural Rate of Increase: Right now, Sweden's NIR is 2.76, so in 2020, Sweden had about 2 more kids per every thousand than at the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Infant Mortality Rate: IMR being at 1.846 per 1000 is a historical low for them. This number shows that for every 1000 living births, there are about 2 infant deaths in the past year. </li>
            <li>Total Fertility Rate: At around 1.85 Sweden has a fairly low TFR. The TFR shows the average amount of children a woman will have in her childbearing years.</li>

                <p>
                    Sweden's pyramid shape is stationary. Due to the bulge in the middle of the pyramid we can conclude that sweden has a good sized workforce. We can infer that Sweden is in stage 4 of the demographic transition model because of its thin straight shape; this also lets us conclude they are a developed country with a steady population. The slow tapering of the pyramid's tip shows that Sweden has good medicine and technologies. It has a fairly even distribution of men and woman meaning Sweden doesn't have any policies regarding gender. The somewhat even distribution of ages shows that in recent years Sweden has had no baby booms, mass migrations, epidemics, etc.

                    <p>Demographic Transition Model (DMT): A model used to show the change in population patterns as a country develops more. It has 5 different stages. One, where NIR is low and very high CBR & CDR. Two, increasing NIR, lowering CDR, and high CBR. Three, decreacing NIR, Low CDR, and lowering CBR. Four, low/zero NIR, very low CDR & CBR. Finally, the theroretical stage, five, negative NIR, low CDR, and very low CBR.</p>

                <p>Looking at our previous data we can see that Sweden is in stage 4 of the DTM. This is because Sweden has a very low growth rate along with low CBR and CDR which according to the diagram shows it is in stage 4.</p>

                    <p>Push Factor: A factor in a place that makes someone want to emmigrate that place.</p>

                    <p>If we relate this to Sweden you can see that a major push factor of Sweden is its lack of farming opportunity, and also its colder climate. Some major pull factors however would include higher wages, or just from nordic countries to one another is very easy. A quick input is that Sweden loses some people in the U.S brain drain. After looking at all this information (and some others) we can see that Sweden would have net-in migration.</p>

                <p> Refugee: A person that is forced to migrate from their home country and can't return due to a certain factor.</p>

                <p>Asylum Seeker: A person that has migrated to another country in hope of being recognized as a refugee.</p>
            
                <p>Sweden gets the most refugees of any northeastern European country. While this is true they dont get very many refugees, they mostly get immigrants from neighboring contries. This is because Sweden isn't that close to any contries in a state of serios refugee output.</p>
